> Amazon Rekognition makes gender binary (man, woman, girl, etc.) predictions
> based on the physical appearance of a person in a particular image. This kind
> of prediction is not designed to categorize a personâ€™s gender identity, and
> you shouldn't use Amazon Rekognition to make such a determination. For
> example, a male actor wearing a long-haired wig and earrings for a role might
> be predicted as female.
>
> Using Amazon Rekognition to make gender binary predictions is best suited for
> use cases where aggregate gender distribution statistics need to be analyzed
> without identifying specific users. For example, the percentage of users who
> are women compared to men on a social media platform.
>
> We don't recommend using gender binary predictions to make decisions that
> impact an individual's rights, privacy, or access to services.

> Amazon Rekognition Image and Amazon Rekognition Video use a hierarchical
> taxonomy of ancestor labels to categorize labels. For example, a person
> walking across a road might be detected as a Pedestrian. The parent label for
> Pedestrian is Person. Both of these labels are returned in the response. All
> ancestor labels are returned and a given label contains a list of its parent
> and other ancestor labels. For example, grandparent and great grandparent
> labels, if they exist. You can use parent labels to build groups of related
> labels and to allow querying of similar labels in one or more images. For
> example, a query for all Vehicles might return a car from one image and a
> motor bike from another.

## Project summary

Analyze and evaluate the label data generated by AWS Rekognition to determine
its suitability for use, including identifying tags to reject and setting an
accuracy threshold. This will contribute to the improvement of result relevancy
in Openverse.

## Goals

- Improve result relevancy in Openverse by refining image tags.

## Requirements

1. Analyze the raw label data obtained from AWS Rekognition to identify the most
   common tags and their associated accuracy scores.
2. Determine which tags should be rejected based on their relevance, quality,
   and other criteria.
3. Establish an accuracy threshold for tags to be considered suitable for use in
   the project.
4. Generate a comprehensive list of all tags generated by Rekognition, along
   with their evaluation results.
5. Create a report summarizing the findings and recommendations for future use
   of AWS Rekognition in similar projects.
6. Add the new, suitable image tags to the media in Openverse.

## Success

Success for this project will be measured by:

1. Generating a curated list of suitable tags and their corresponding accuracy
   threshold.
2. Providing clear recommendations for tag rejection and accuracy threshold
   based on the data analysis.
3. Completing a comprehensive report on the evaluation of the Rekognition data.
4. Successfully adding new image tags to the media in Openverse, contributing to
   improved result relevancy.

## Participants and stakeholders

- Implementers - TBD

## Infrastructure

No specific infrastructure considerations for this project.

## Accessibility

No specific accessibility concerns for this project. The focus is on improving
result relevancy by refining image tags, which should enhance the overall user
experience in Openverse.

## Marketing

We could make a general announcement about improved result quality to our users,
highlighting the enhancements made to the image tagging system and how it
contributes to better search results and user experience in Openverse.

## Required implementation plans:

- Data analysis and evaluation:
  - Analyze the raw label data obtained from AWS Rekognition.
  - Identify the most common tags and their associated accuracy scores.
  - Determine the tags to reject and establish an accuracy threshold.
- Tag integration and report generation:
  - Generate a comprehensive list of evaluated tags.
  - Add the new, suitable image tags to the media in Openverse. Create a report
    summarizing the findings and recommendations for future use of AWS -
    Rekognition in similar projects.
- Marketing and user communication: Coordinate with the community and prepare a
  general announcement about improved result - quality in Openverse. Share the
  announcement with users, emphasizing the contribution of refined image tags
  to - better search results and overall user experience.
